#Stacked Autoencoder

##1.Summary

    I am very excited to arrive this session which has a algorithm much more like deep learning network.
    
    This article is going to introduce stacked autoencoder from 6 aspect.
    
    (1) Advantages of deep networks over shallow networks 
    
    (2) The problems of traditional deep network.
    
    (3) Greedy layer-wise training
    
    (4) Stacked autoencoder classification
    
    (5) Fine-tuning 
    
    (6) Experiment
    
##2. Advantages of deep networks over shallow networks 
    
        The primary advantage is that it can compactly represent a significantly larger set of fuctions than 
    
    shallow networks. In other words, if a shallow network want to achieve the same performance , it must have much 
    
    more hidden layer nodes than a deep network. Thus, deep network is more efficient.
    
##3 The problems of traditional deep network

    Data probelm. Tranditional deep network need labeled data which is scarcity. If tranditional deep network don't 
    
    have enough input data ,Over fitting will happen.
