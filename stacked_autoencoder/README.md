#Stacked Autoencoder

##1.Summary

    I am very excited to arrive this session which has a algorithm much more like deep learning network.
    
    This article is going to introduce stacked autoencoder from 3 aspect.
    
    (1) Advantages of deep networks over shallow networks 
    
    (2) The problems of traditional deep network.
    
    (3) Greedy layer-wise training
    
    (4) Stacked autoencoder classification
    
    (5) Fine-tuning 
    
    (6) Experiment
