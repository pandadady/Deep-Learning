#Principal Component Analysis
##1.Summary

    Principal component analysis is a method of dimension reduction,It finds out a few synthetic 
    
    variables from many variables, which can represent the information of the original variables 
    
    as much as possible, and they are not related to each other.In mathematics, This data 
    
    transformation method is called linear transformation. There may be many sorts of linear transformation
    
    composation to achvieve transformation. Almong these,PCA wants to search a transformation along the 
    
    direction of maximum variance.

    F1 is the first principal component. F2 is the second principal component.
    
    Any two principal components are linearly independent
