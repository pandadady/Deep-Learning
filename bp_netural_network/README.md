#BP neural network

###1.Summary
    
    It is a classic neural network algorithm. Tutorials on this algorithm are everywhere.
    
    This page don't intent to explain in detailï¼Œbut will explain the core related to algorithm achieve.
    
###2.Structure

    the simplest possible neural network, one which comprises a single "neuron."
    
    This "neuron" is a computational unit that takes as input x1,x2,x3 (and a +1 intercept term),
    
    and outputs is as follow.

    f() is called activation function. Common activation function table is as follows

    A neural network is composed by many simple "neurons," so that the output of a neuron can be the 
    
    input of another.For example, here is a small neural network:

    The most left layer is input layer. The middle layers are called hidden layer. The most right layer is 
    
    output layer. Weight is used to connect any two neurons in the two layer.
    
    Alpha is activation value. 
    
###3.Process

    The algorithm has 2 processes to need to finish in one time iteration.
    
    First process is forward propagation. It is a process of prediction or classification.
