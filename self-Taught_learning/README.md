#Self-Taught Learning
##1.Summary
    
    The most efficent method of ML or DL algorithm improvinng is to provide more traning data.
    
    Manual marking is known as the important method of training data production. Its disadvantage 
    
    is low efficiency and high cost of labor. Self-Taught learning is builded to solve those problem.
    
    It is able to learning features from unlabeled training data. Even though a single unlabeled example 
    
    is less informative than a single labeled example, the number of unlabeled data is much more than 
    
    that of the labeled data. When DL or ML algorithm is able to exploit this unlabeled data effectively
    
    then we might be able to achieve better performance than the massive hand-engineering and massive 
    
    hand-labeling approaches.
